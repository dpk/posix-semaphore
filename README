WARNING! DO NOT USE!!

This package is unfixably buggy because of an incorrect assumption made
by the Ruby interpreter that causes crashes on (at least) Mac OS X.

Mac OS X (and presumably some other Unix variants) allocate semaphore
IDs from the same integer pool as file descriptors. Ruby, not entirely
unreasonably, assumes that any integer in the pool of 'used' file-
descriptor numbers can be successfully fstat(2)-ed, and does this
occasionally on random file descriptors. But the fd numbers used by
semaphores arenâ€™t files, they're semaphores, so fstat(2) fails even
though Ruby expects it to be a valid file descriptor.

I'm not sure if this is a bug in Ruby or in Mac OS X. I wouldn't hold
my breath about either of them fixing the problem.

POSIX semaphores! In Ruby! Whatever next?

Limitations:

Currently only named semaphores are supported.
